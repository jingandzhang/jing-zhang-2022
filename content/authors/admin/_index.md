I am a graduate student in cognitive neuroscience at the [Sleep and Cognition Lab](http://sleepandcognitionlab.org) (PI: [Sara Mednick](https://www.saramednick.com)). My research interests include cognitive processing and autonomic activities during sleep, with an overarching goal to understand the neural mechanism of sleep-dependent memory associated with aging and sex using brain-imaging tools including EEG and fMRI. 

Also a [science communicator](https://lohdownonscience.com/author/jingz18/) and a [foodie](https://www.instagram.com/socalishungry).
